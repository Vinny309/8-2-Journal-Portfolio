How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs can be done through talking to users and listening to what they want or need . In Module 3 , there was a focus group between the product owner and some SNHU Travel customers . The product owner asked about what they would like to see and listened to their responses . This gave the Product Owner a place to start with what the users are looking for in a product . The Product Owner then created user stories based on what the customers said and included things they would like to see . By doing this , the user stories help to implement what the users need out of the product .
